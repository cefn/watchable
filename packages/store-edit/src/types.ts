/**  A function passed to {@link edit}. The editor is called back with a
 * `draft` - a mutable proxy of the Store's current `Immutable` `RootState`.
 *
 * You can make changes to the mutable `draft` proxy within your editor callback
 * using any javascript syntax. When it returns,
 * {@link https://immerjs.github.io/immer/ | Immer} efficiently composes a new
 * {@link Immutable} state to reflect your drafted changes, leaving the old state
 * intact. The new state is passed to [[Store.write]].
 *
 * The editor is equivalent to Immer's producer except returning a value doesn't
 * replace the {@link RootState}. To replace the state call [[Store.write]] instead
 * of using an editor. This eliminates Immer's runtime errors when you **draft**
 * changes as well as returning a value, (easily done by accident in simple
 * arrow functions).
 *
 * See {@link https://immerjs.github.io/immer/ | Immer docs} for more detail on
 * the conventions for Immer `producers`.
 *
 * @param draft A mutable proxy of a {@link Store}'s existing `Immutable` state.
 * Manipulate this object to compose the next state.
