/** A `Store` keeps an Immutable {@link RootState}, (any array, tuple or
 * object), which can be changed and monitored for changes to drive an app. Make
 * a new `Store` by calling {@link createStore} with an `initialState`.
 *
 * Flagging all state references as {@link Immutable} guides IDEs to treat these
 * as {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object | Immutable Objects}
 * to avoid programming errors.
 *
 * ## Watching State
 *
 * Assigning a new {@link @watchable/store!Immutable} `RootState` using
 * {@link @watchable/store!WatchableState.write} notifies {@link Watcher | Watchers}
 * previously subscribed using {@link @watchable/store!Watchable.watch}. This
 * mechanism ensures that app logic and renderers can track the latest state.
 *
 * ## Immutable State: Motivation
 *
 * Never modifying the state tree means when the state or a
 * {@link Selector | selected} branch of the state is the same ***item*** as
 * before, it is guaranteed to contain all the same ***values*** as before. This
 * guarantee is crucial.
 *
 * Immutability allows Watchers you write, renderers like
 * {@link https://reactjs.org/ | React} and memoizers like
 * {@link https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect | Reselect} or React's
 * [useMemo()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo) to use
 * 'shallow equality checking'. There can only have been changes to an item's
 * descendants (that might trigger a re-render or recompute) if
 * `Object.is(prevItem,nextItem)===false`.
 *
 * Immutability eliminates bugs and race conditions in state-change event
 * handlers. Handlers notified of a change effectively have a snapshot of state.
 * You don't have to handle cases where other code changed the state again
 * before your handler read the data.
 *
 * Finally, Immutability establishes a basis for advanced debugging techniques
 * such as time-travel debugging since every state change notification includes
 * a momentary snapshot of the app state which can be stored indefinitely.

/** An item satisfying type constraints of {@link RootState} but where a child item
 * at `Key` ***also*** satisfies `RootState`. A Store with a
 * {@link PartitionableState} can therefore be partitioned into a child {@link Store} by
 * `Key`.
 *
 * Partitioning enables hierarchy and logical isolation of a {@link Store}, so that
 * higher-level stores can be composed of multiple lower-level stores. Logic
 * relying on some `Store<T>` need not know whether `<T>` is the whole app state
 * or just some part of it.
 *
 * Partitioning can also make eventing more efficient. When a parent Store's
 * `RootState` changes, implementations can omit notifications for all
 * {@link Watcher | Watchers} of a child partition if the child {@link RootState} has not
 * changed, meaning no value within the child partition has changed.
 *
 * See also {@link createStorePartition}.
