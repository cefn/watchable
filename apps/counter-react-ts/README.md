# Counter (Typescript)

This minimal Typescript app shows how to bind React views and controls to shared state that is managed independently of React. See also the [Javascript version of this app](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter-react-js)

To run the code in an editable sandbox visit https://stackblitz.com/github/cefn/watchable/tree/main/apps/counter-react-ts?file=src/ui.tsx

Use `npm install` then `npm run dev` to demo the application locally.

See [logic.ts](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter-react-ts/src/logic.ts) and [ui.tsx](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter-react-ts/src/ui.tsx) to understand how it works.

This project builds and runs using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
