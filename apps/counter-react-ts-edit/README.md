# Counter (Typescript with @lauf/store-edit)

This is identical to the [Standard counter app](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter-react-ts) except it uses [@lauf/store-edit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lauf/store-edit) to avoid the developer having to learn and follow [Immutable update patterns](https://redux.js.org/usage/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns).
