This Counter app is identical to the other ones, but tuned for the tiniest possible bundle. The result is a bundle of just 424 bytes combining the fully reactive `@watchable/store` state library and the app logic.

[Open this app in a Stackblitz editable sandbox](https://stackblitz.com/github/cefn/watchable/tree/main/apps/counter-dom-tiny?file=src/main.js)

- Like all counter-dom-\* apps this uses the dom directly, avoiding the (~45k gzip) overhead of React
- It doesn't use the promise support of a `@watchable/store-follow` queue. It uses watcher callbacks instead.
- It includes no polyfills for legacy browsers or module preload
- It uses `terser` instead of `esbuild` for minification
